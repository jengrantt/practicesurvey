# This assignment was the first time I created an interactive survey for users to respond to. This project required a bank end and front end HTML script. 
# The survey predicts a users salary based on characteristics like age, gender, company size, etc. This is the first step of many repositories that I made to create the perfect interactive survey for users that would attempt to predict your salary correctly. I was able to learn how to make drop downs of potential list answers and a submmit button. This was a very interesting weekly homework for me that I really enjoyed working on with the help of my classmates and professor Colbert.
